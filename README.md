# C--Compiler   
This is a compiler for the fictional C- programming language. There are four phases, two of which are currently complete. 



Phase One: Lexical Analysis 
----------------------------------  
The "lexer" processes text using regular expressions and converts this text into an arraylist of tokens which are passed to the parser. 



Phase Two: Syntactic Analysis 
----------------------------------
This is a recursive descent "parser" that uses a one-token lookahead to iterate through the arraylist of tokens in accordance with the rules of the C- grammar. 




Phase Three: Semantic Analysis 
----------------------------------
IN PROGRESS 



Phase Four: Code Generation 
---------------------------------- 
IN PROGRESS
